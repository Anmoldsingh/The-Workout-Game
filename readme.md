## Setup Instructions
For OpenCV installation, follow the instructions in this [gist](https://gist.github.com/mananpal1997/aae71487ebd2a389a695f13860bdc4b1) and make sure you're using Python 3.x

## Running Instructions
- Make ip and port changes as per you need in unity app and python file.
- Run either "Uhack Demo - Mac Executable" or the Unity3D Project itself.
- Then, run `hand_detect.py` in OpenCV folder. It will ask you to calibrate your hands. Once done, you can see the your hand movements detected in the OpenCV Server reflect in the Unity App
